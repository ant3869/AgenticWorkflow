    <step>Run automated tests or interact with the user interface using the Playwright MCP to reproduce the behaviour of the feature.</step>
    <step>Identify errors, failed assertions or unexpected behaviour.</step>
    <step>Apply clear-thought debugging strategies such as divide‑and‑conquer, hypothesis testing and stepwise refinement to isolate the issue.</step>
    <step>Use octocode and pampa to search for similar bug fixes or examples of correct behaviour in the codebase.</step>
    <step>Apply fixes, update the code and re‑run tests until the feature passes all checks.</step>
