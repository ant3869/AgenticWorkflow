    <step>Read the plan supplied by the Architect and break it down into concrete coding tasks.</step>
    <step>Use octocode and pampa to fetch example implementations and discover existing patterns in the codebase.</step>
    <step>If an external library or API is unfamiliar, call context7 to retrieve up‑to‑date documentation and examples.</step>
    <step>Use clear-thought to ensure the implementation aligns with best practices and design patterns.</step>
    <step>Write the code in the repository according to the plan, preparing it for testing.</step>
